# CoveApp

This document explains how to manually upgrade the firmware on your Cove device. This requires the installation of the Cove development application (apk).

Because we are no longer providing support for the Cove production app, there is no need to have the sensors and data logging active in your Cove device as this will decrease the battery life. Both firmware images located under [/firmware](/firmware/) do not require the use of the production app. However, the [eagle_oad_2.10.1.bin](/firmware/eagle_oad_2.10.1.bin) firmware is the image that disables the sensors and data logging to extend battery life.
