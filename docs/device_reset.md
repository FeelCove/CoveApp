# Cove reset

The device may need to be soft reset or factory (hard) reset if any unrecoverable errors occur. See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for more info.

## Soft Resetting your Cove

To perform a soft reset:
- If Cove is charging, disconnect the USB charger from your Cove.
- Press and hold the power button for 10 secs or more until you see the LED turn back on to a solid green, and then release the button.

## Restoring Cove to the factory settings

To perform a hard reset (factory restore):
- If Cove is charging, disconnect the USB charger from your Cove.
- Press and hold both the power and volume down buttons for 20 seconds and then release.
- If the hard reset was successful, the LED will turn back on to a solid green after 30 seconds or so.
