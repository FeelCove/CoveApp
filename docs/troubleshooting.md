# Troubleshooting

- LED blinks amber for a few secs when single pressing the power button. See [[Unlocking the Cove device](docs/device_unlocking.md)]

- LED blinks red for a second when single pressing the power button. This means that the device battery doesn't have enough charge to run a session. Please fully charge the device to clear this error. The LED will change from blinking green to solid green when fully charged, and it will automatically turn off after 3 mins in this state.

- The device will not power ON with a long press (~3 secs) of the power button or by plugging in the USB charger. This may be an issue with the battery being depleted, but the issue may be fixed by a 1) soft reset, 2) factory restore. See [Device Reset](docs/device_reset.md).

- The device remains ON even after 3 minutes of the session ending.

- Cannot feel the vibrations.

- Cannot connect to the development app.
