# Connecting Cove to Android development app

1. Install the Android apk [android_dev.apk](../apk/android_dev.apk) on your mobile device. See section [Downloading and installing Android apk](download_install_apk.md).

2. If you have multiple Cove devices then ensure that all other Cove devices, except for the one that you wish to upgrade, are off or far away from the area in which you'll be working.

3. Connect the Cove device to the USB charger. The LED should start blinking green. However, the LED may remain solid green if the device is fully charged.

4. From the development console, tap the gear icon in the top-left corner to access the menu. Tap the “Connect” button to connect your Cove. If this is the first time connecting your Cove, accept the request to “Pair and connect” when prompted.
