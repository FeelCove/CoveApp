# Connecting Cove to Android development app

- Install the Android apk [android_dev.apk](../apk/android_dev.apk) on your mobile device. See section [Downloading and installing Android apk](download_install_apk.md) above.

- If you have multiple Cove devices then ensure that all other Cove devices, except for the one that you wish to upgrade, are off or far away from the area in which you'll be working.

- Connect the Cove device to the USB charger. The LED should start blinking green. However, the LED may remain solid green if the device is fully charged.

- From the development console, swipe right to open the menu and press on the 'CONNECT' button, as shown below. While the device and phone are trying to connect, Android will ask you to if you want to 'Pair and Connect' to Cove, choose 'Yes'.

- You may need to repeat the 'Connect' step more than once, if Cove gets disconnected by the phone. When the phone and Cove are connected, the development console will look as follows:
