# Downloading and installing Android development apk

- Download the [android_dev.apk](../apk/android_dev.apk) file to your mobile device.
- Locate the apk file on your mobile device after downloading it.
- Select the file and choose “Install”.
- Find and tap the 'Cove DEV' app icon; the main screen is shown below. No need to login to the app, as we just want to get to the development console.

- The development console is now active (as shown below), and we can now connect to the Cove device. See next section: [Upgrading firmware with apk](docs/firmware_upgrade.md) to follow the instructions for connecting and upgrading the firmware on your Cove device.
